/**
 * Liquid Hover — two images, and a hover that pours one into the other through a
 * displacement map.
 *
 * Rebuilt from a Framer codegen bundle that pulled three.js r122, GSAP 2 and the
 * hover-effect UMD package off three separate CDNs at runtime, then reached for
 * them through window globals. None of that is here. The whole effect is one
 * fragment shader over a single quad, the ramp is a timestep and an ease, and
 * three comes from the project's own dependency — so it renders with no network
 * beyond the images themselves and cannot be broken by a CDN or a version bump.
 *
 * The displacement is read as a two-channel offset: red pushes the outgoing
 * image's sample sideways, green pushes it up, and the incoming image is pushed
 * the opposite way by what is left of the ramp. Two samples sliding past each
 * other in opposite directions is what reads as liquid — a plain crossfade of the
 * same two pictures reads as a dissolve.
